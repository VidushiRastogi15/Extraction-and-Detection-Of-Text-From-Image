#INTRODUCTION
Extracting text from images is a very popular task in the operations units of the business as well as in other areas. This model provides scene text detection or bounding boxes of text in an image. These bounding boxes can then be passed to an Optical character recognition (OCR) engine for enhanced text recognition accuracy.

#Research Gap and Motivation 
1). CAPTCHA Detection Is Still Unwithered Field.
2). Scene Complexity And Uneven Lighting
3). Multilingual Text Lacks A Lot Of Research
4). Artistic Fonts Are Untouched Field 

#Proposed Methodology
1). Data Acquisition.
2). Data Preprocessing.
3). Text Detection and Extraction.
4). Text Enhancement.
5). Text Segmentation.
6). Text Recognition and Processing.

#Conclusion and Future Work
The extraction of textual data from scanned documents or images (PDF, TIFF, JPG) into model-understandable data is known as optical character recognition (OCR). OCR solutions are designed to make information more accessible to users. It enhances company operations and processes by reducing the amount of time and resources required to maintain unsearchable or difficult-to-find data.![image](https://github.com/VidushiRastogi15/Extraction-and-Detection-Of-Text-From-Image/assets/118375146/44639aec-0c86-41a5-8dc3-8a5439bdb8a4)
