# EXTRACTION AND DETECTION OF TEXT FROM IMAGES
## INTRODUCTION
<p>Extracting text from images is a very popular task in the operations units of the business as well as in other areas. This model provides scene text detection or bounding boxes of text in an image.</p> 
<p>These bounding boxes can then be passed to an Optical character recognition (OCR) engine for enhanced text recognition accuracy.</p>

## Research Gap and Motivation 

<li>CAPTCHA Detection Is Still Unwithered Field.</li>
<li>Scene Complexity And Uneven Lighting.</li>
<li>Multilingual Text Lacks A Lot Of Research.</li>
<li>Artistic Fonts Are Untouched Field.</li>

## Proposed Methodology
  
<li>Data Acquisition.</li>
<li>Data Preprocessing.</li>
<li>Text Detection and Extraction.</li>
<li>Text Enhancement.</li>
<li>Text Segmentation.</li>
<li>Text Recognition and Processing.</li>

  
## Conclusion and Future Work
<p>The extraction of textual data from scanned documents or images (PDF, TIFF, JPG) into model-understandable data is known as optical character recognition (OCR). OCR solutions are designed to make information more accessible to users.</p>
<p>It enhances company operations and processes by reducing the amount of time and resources required to maintain unsearchable or difficult-to-find data. </p>
